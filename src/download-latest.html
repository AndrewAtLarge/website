  <p>This is the most recent development release (beta or release candidate).</p>
  <p>Downloading this source tarball gives you the same version as cloning
    <a href="https://github.com/sagemath/sage">the "develop" branch
      of the main Sage repository</a> on GitHub.
  </p>
  <p>Thanks to rigorous integration testing by the Release Manager,
    development releases are generally safe to use, but be aware that
    occasionally some breakage occurs.</p>
  <p>New development releases are published every 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
